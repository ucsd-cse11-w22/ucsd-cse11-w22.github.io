# UCSD CSE 11 Winter 2022
## Accelerated Intro to Programming

_Greg Miranda_

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and practice organizing programs for
clarity and re-use.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

On an average week in CSE11, you can expect to spend 4-6 hours on videos,
reading, lecture, and discussion; 2-3 hours on programming practice; and 4-6
hours working on your programming projects. If you find yourself spending
dramatically more time than this, it's a good idea to contact the course staff
and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

## Course Components

There are a few components to your grade in the course:

- Completing book exercises in Stepik and surveys (20%)
- Programming assignments (20%)
- Programming exams (60%)

Your final letter grade will be calculated as follows:

![Grades](grades.png)

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on a number of
factors that we will not publicize), but we guarantee that we will not adjust
the scale to make it harder to get a better grade. We will not adjust the scale
for individual students. Pluses and minuses will be given at the instructors'
discretion around the boundaries of these categorizations.

<h3>Problem Sessions – Lecture</h3>

Most course content will be presented asynchronously through videos and
readings, with associated interactive activities. Lectures will involve problem
solving with your classmates. Participation is not required at problem-solving
sections, but it is highly encouraged.

For the first two weeks, lectures will be remote (see Canvas for Zoom link). 
Starting in Week 3, lectures will move to in-person. 

**Remote sessions** will be led during the normally-scheduled lecture times
on Zoom, led by the instructor. These sessions will be recorded and uploaded
several hours after the lecture. You can find the recordings in the Canvas Media Gallery. 

**In-person sessions** will be led during the normally-scheduled lecture times
in the normally-scheduled room, led by the instructor. These sessions will be
recorded by podcasting but will not be available remotely while they are ongoing. 
You can find the recordings in the Canvas Media Gallery or at [podcast.ucsd.edu](https://podcast.ucsd.edu)

Since these lectures may be mostly student discussion, the recordings are mostly 
an archive of any live demos that come up rather than a presentation of core content.

<h3>Discussion</h3>

Teaching Assistants (TAs) will hold a weekly discussion section to
cover the weekly programmoing assignment, review prior content, and answer
student questions. Participation is not required at problem-solving
sections, but it is highly encouraged.

For the first two weeks, discussions will be remote (see Canvas for Zoom link). 
Starting in Week 3, discussions will move to in-person in the normally-sheduled room. 

Like lectures, discussions will also be recorded and made available in the 
Cavnas Media Gallery.

### Book Exercises/Quizzes and Course Engagement

Along with each lecture will come some required pre-lecture work. Most often
this will be reading and activities from our [Stepik
textbook](https://stepik.org/course/100177/syllabus), and will also sometimes
include surveys or check-in quizzes so we can get your feedback about the course
and check on your understanding.

The online texbook records your progress, and we give a schedule of expected
times to finish the readings. There is no penalty for completing these late, but
they are assigned so that you will be prepared to participate in problem solving
session and so that you know the expected pace of the course. 

All Stepik exercises must be completed by the last day of class in Week 10: March 11, 2022 at 10pm.
After this time, no late submissions will be accepted, for any reason.

To ensure you get credit for the Stepik exercises, you must fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/4MqJwT7R2YiM2nLE9)
by Friday of Week 2. Starting in Week 3, we will strive to post Stepik grades to Canvas every week.

<h3>Programming</h3>

Most weeks there will be a programming assignment. Direct practice with
programming will make up the majority of your work in the course.

There are numerous opportunities to get feedback on your work and improve:

- **Shortly after the deadline** the deadline for each assignment, a staff member 
will grade your work and get feedback on what, if anything, you need to fix.

- **After you receive your grade** you can continue to improve your assignment
based on the feedback from grading. You can resubmit your work to the Late/Resubmit 
submission and request to have your work regraded up to three more times (for each PA). 
A staff member will grade your resubmission and let you know when it has been graded. 

There is no penalty for resubmissions, you can still earn full credit. 
We will take the highest score between your original submission and your late/resubmissions.

The **Late/Resubmit** process applies if your submission is late. You should strive
to complete each PA before it's posted deadline as the PAs are practice for the exams.
You will also receive earlier feedback and an extra grading attempt if you submit
before the original deadline.

The **Hard deadline** for all late/resubmissions is Friday of Week 10 at 10pm. We will not accept
any submissions after that time, for any reason.


<a id="g:exams"></a>
<h3>Exams</h3>

In place of on-paper exams, we will follow a different procedure for “exams”
this quarter.

Three times during the quarter and once at the time of the final exam, we will
give you a programming assignment that you must complete in a short (24-48
hours) time frame without any help from other people, including the course
staff. The final exam is cumulative, with three sections that each correspond to
the material from one of the in-quarter exams. Your score on the assessment for
a “third” of the course is the **maximum** of your score on that in-quarter exam
and that part on the final. 

For example:

- On the three in-quarter exams you score 75, 0, and 95 (you miss the second). On
the final exam you score 80, 75, and 0 on the three parts. Your assessment scores
are 95, 75, 80, sufficient for a B, but not an A.
- On the three in-quarter exams you score 95, 93, and 90. You skip the final so
your scores are 0, 0, 0. Your assessment scores are 95, 93, 90, sufficient for an
A.
- On the three in-quarter exams you score 75, 55, and 60. On the final you score 95,
90, 94. Your assessment scores are 95, 90, 94, sufficient for an A.

This grading policy also forms the missed exam policy – if you miss an
in-quarter exam, you can make up that credit on the final. If you miss the
final, your in-quarter exam scores will be used. Late work on exams or make-up
exams will not be offered.

You can use any resources, notes, readings, and past code from the course to
help in addition to Web-based resources.  Along with submitting the program, you
will record a short video of yourself presenting the program you wrote,
demonstrating its behavior and your understanding. We'll give some opportunities
for practice with this process, and much more detailed instructions with the
exam release.

We **do not** expect that the programming work and recording will take a full
day of constant work. The tasks will be significantly shorter than the PAs, so this
should only take a few hours. We give the broad range to give you the best
chance to schedule some quiet, focused time to do the work and record the
presentation.

It's worth explaining why we are using this mechanism. There are at least two
reasons:

1. Presenting your code, and demonstrating it via screenshare, is a really
important skill and shows us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this
style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich
way for us to assess your skills.
2. The main thing that in-person, on-paper exams let us do is easily verify
that it is in fact **you**, the student, completing a major assessment. We can
similarly do so with a video.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Individual assignments will describe their academic integrity requirements. You
should pay attention to the descriptions of what collaboration is allowed and
expected on each assignment.

One challenge we face as an instructional team is verifying that students are
submitting their own work given the number of remote and asynchronous options we
provide. In the past, we relied on in-person, ID-checked exams to mitigate this
particular challenge to academic integrity. Assignments and exams will come with
specific policies for what types of collaboration is allowed, but we have one
course-wide policy – we may reach out to students to schedule a check-in on
their understanding of work they've submitted if we're suspicious about an
academic integrity violation.  This would involve a videoconference with a TA or
instructor to check that the student has the understanding demonstrated by their
work. This is in addition to any video screencasts that are submitted as a part
of the exam.

We don't expect to use this option much (certainly **you** are a student that
acts with integrity!), but we state it clearly in the syllabus in case it
becomes necessary so it isn't a surprise to anyone.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
on academic integrity as well.

### Regrades

Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment,
we will allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with
grade release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you
were initially given is final.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community
(https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others’
backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and
help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels
comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and
Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.
