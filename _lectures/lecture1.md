Welcome to the page for the first problem session! Each problem session will

Before the first lecture, there are no videos to watch. You should familiarize
yourself with the [syllabus](../syllabus.html).

The handout for the first day has a few questions for us to use as icebreakers
and to start talking about programming. You can access [the PDF
