# Accelerated Intro to Programming (UCSD CSE 11)
## Fall 2021

Hi! This page is a placeholder for now, addressing some frequently asked
questions we get about CSE11. We may have linked you to this page in response
to an email. Feel free to follow up with jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu with further
questions about the course, unless it's explicitly addressed below.

**I have a question about enrollments and the waitlist.**

Please contact [CSE student
affairs](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate/advising/cse-student-affairs-office-hours),
who can give the best advice and information about the enrollment process. They
are friendly and helpful and know much more about timing and any updates you
will see through the registration system.

There is some useful advice at [Enrolling in CSE
Courses](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/enrolling-cse-courses) that
likely summarizes a lot of what they would tell you to get you started.

**Will the course be in person or remote?**

Right now we're expecting to run CSE11 in person in lecture halls and computer
labs, per [campus
announcements](https://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2021/2021-4-5-3.html?_ga=2.68189841.1679226630.1617638163-1407889900.1563300100).
We'll update here if that changes; right now we're not positive if there will
be an official hybrid option.

**Is attendance required?**

This policy is subject to change given the uncertainty of university, local,
national, and global policy.

There are several options for attending lectures and getting participation
credit in this course. All of them require **synchronous** participation and
discussion with your classmates. Both in-person and remote options are
available.

The content of the course is primarily delivered through an online textbook and
through pre-recorded videos from the instructors. The synchronous sessions are
for problem-solving with your classmates and Q&A with the instructional team.
In each session, you will work in pairs or small groups on problems that we
provide and we will go over them as a group.

**In-person sessions** will be led during the normally-scheduled lecture times in the normally-scheduled
rooms, led by the instructors. These sessions will be recorded but
will not be available remotely while they are ongoing.

**Remote sessions** include all of the normally scheduled discussion sections for the
course, which are on the same days as in-person lectures, and at a variety of
times.


For credit you **must** attend a section on each day (Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday), but you can attend any section or different sections across the days,
with some small number of allowed absences.

As an exception to the class being synchronous, the **final exam** will have an
asynchronous format. Students will not be required to take the final exam
during the scheduled block, and there will be some flexibility on when it is
completed the day of the exam (but not necessarily flexibility to take it on
other days).

**What's the course material like?**

You can see a [previous version of the
course](https://ucsd-cse11-s20.github.io/), which will give you a sense. This
offering will not be identical, but will be similar.

**I'm not sure if I should take CSE11 or CSE8A.**

We endorse the [CSE course placement
advice](https://cse.ucsd.edu/index.php/undergraduate/courses/cse-course-placement-advice).
Also feel free to message jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu if you're not sure.

**What if I have enrolled in CSE11 but won't be able to be in La Jolla for most
or all of Fall 2021?**

If the attendance policy above doesn't address your situation, please contact
`jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`.
